            <h2>Pride & Prejudice</h2>
            <p><img src="/img/books/pride_prejudice.jpg" alt="Book cover of Pride & Prejudice, Penguin Clothbound Classics edition" class="book-cover">I picked up 'Pride & Prejudice' (Jane Austen, 1813) fairly quickly after finishing Jane Eyre, and I already knew beforehand that I'd really enjoy this book, as it is somewhat sweeter and quicker than the other. And I did! The book reads like a soap serie, leaving me more curious with every chapter, and often prompting me put the book down to let everything sink in. Jane Austen is so well-read and intelligent, yet can convey such innocently sweet feelings through the characters. Her mastery of storytelling, combined with her keen wit and insight into human nature, makes this novel a delightful and thought-provoking read. The genuine interactions between the characters made me realise that the silly, everyday peculiarities of human relationships have remained surprisingly consistent over the past 200 years.</p>
            <p>I like how the the book isn't just about romance; the focus on Elizabeth's introspection and personal growth is just as important to me, if not more so. The 2005 movie fails to capture how awkward she is in the majority of her interactions, how (arguably unjustifiably) hurt she was after Charlotte compromised her set of morals, and how depressed and embarrassed she got after discovering her own judgemental tendencies. However, she is also humorous, enjoys pleasant company, possesses social grace and elegance, cares deeply for her family, and longs for love and companionship. This blend of moral integrity and more tender qualities wrap together a beautifully complex and relatable character!</p>
            <p>Reading this book made me take today's social antics slightly easier, simultaneously inspiring me to soften my features and increase my intellect. As corny as it sounds, it is difficult for a young adult to craft a personality that is <i>good</i> yet fun; righteous but deserving of nice things. Saying this book was a breath of fresh air for me would be an understatement. <b>26.6.23</b></p>

            <h2>Jane Eyre</h2>
            <p><img src="/img/books/jane_eyre.jpg" alt="Book cover of Jane Eyre, Penguin Popular Classics edition" class="book-cover">I'm pretty sure this is the first novel I've finished since high school, and although it took some reluctant effort (and a friend eager to discuss it with me), I'm glad I read it. 'Jane Eyre' (Charlotte Brontë, 1847) is a gothic novel, and as such, you must accept that it's slow, romantic, and almost fairytale-like. I liked it how it is. I am a fan of bildungsromans in general<span class="footnote" data-content="I also had a great time reading 'De Tweeling' by Tessa de Loo. ♡"></span>, and I found the feelings of the protagonist throughout the whole journey very realistic<span class="footnote" data-content="Opposing some TikTok-famous books I tried before, which were so shallow, I couldn't get through them at all!"></span>.</p>
            <p>Something I don't see too often when reading reviews is appreciation of Jane's deadpan nature. I found it a delight to read her being sensitive in her thoughts but so direct and dry when speaking to others. It's comforting to read the thoughts of other people who are evidently warm, but don't have the natural urge to show that in their speech, and don't force themselves to do so. And this made Mr. Rochester's frequent teasing and way of pushing Jane's buttons all the more interesting. Delicious! <b>8.4.23</b></p>
